    <p>So... I'm not really sure what I'm going to add here yet. I've been trying to learn html for the past... <em>year</em>? Few months? 
Without success as you could probably tell. Everytime I tried I would always drop it like so many other things I do. 
But I picked it back up again today since it's my 1st day of school, so here's to maybe sticking with learning web design finally?

I usually go by the name Yamgeta1406 on other sites, so maybe you could send me learning tips or encouragement, maybe?
